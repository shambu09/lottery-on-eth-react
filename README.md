## Getting Started
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
    Installs the dependencies.

### `npm start`

    Runs the app in the development mode.
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits.
    You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run deploy`

    `gh-pages` builds and deploys the app in your origin's repo and creates the github pages configuration.
